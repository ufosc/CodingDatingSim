## Installation

### Prerequisites 
This project requires [Python](ttps://www.python.org/downloads/) and the [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/) SDK to run. You can install them from here
- Python (Latest): https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Ren'Py (8.1.1 or greater): https://www.renpy.org/latest.html

### Setup

Once you have downloaded the Ren'py SDK, extract it into your project directory. 

Now, you can fork the repository and clone it into the root directory of the SDK using this command using ssh or http:

In the ```renpy.8.1.1-sdk``` folder.

SSH
        
        git clone git@github.com:user/VisualNovel.git 

HTTP

        git clone https://github.com/user/VisualNovel.git

You can start up the Ren'Py launcher by launching ```renpy.exe``` in the ```renpy.8.1.1-sdk``` directory. If you are a Mac user, launch via ```renpy``` instead of ```renpy.exe```. On Linux, launch via ```renpy.sh```. Once the launcher opens, the project should show up in the projects tab as UFOSC.

If the project is not showing up you need to set the project directory manually. This is done by navigating to ``` preferences``` located under the Launch Project button on the botton right. 

Then under ```Project Directory```, update the project directory to ```renpy-8.1.1-sdk/VisualNovel``` or the parent folder that UFOSC is located in.

The program and games file can be edited in the ```scripts.py``` file in the UFOSC folder.
