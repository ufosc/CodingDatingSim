    mc "Hey Python and C++, what did you guys get for lunch?"
    p "*Says nothing*"
    mc "Look, I’m sorry about what happened earlier."
    mc "Do you think we can move past this and start over?"
    p "I guess it would be nice if we all got along."
    p "What do you think, C++?"
    c "I don’t care, do whatever you want."
    p "It’s settled then."
    p "No hard feelings, we’re all friends here."
    mc "Great. What did you get for lunch?"
    p "I got a beef burrito and a side of plantains for lunch."
    p "It looks really good and I am starving!"
    mc "Yeah me too, I didn’t even get to eat breakfast."
    c "Why not? You’re so stupid you don’t know how to cook?"
    c "*Sighs* Sorry that was mean, why didn’t you get breakfast?"
    mc "My morning was a mess."
    mc "I am from an area about 4 hours away from here and so I had to stay in a hotel."
    mc "And last night I was up way too late."
    mc "And as you can guess I didn’t wake up on time."
    c "Did you make it to orientation on time?"
    mc "Well that was the worst part."
    mc "I rushed out the door and got in my car in like 3 minutes"
    mc "But when I started driving I realized I didn’t even know where the school was."
    p "Yeah I ran into the same problem."
    p "I have never been to this town before."
    mc "Then I eventually got here and I realized I missed all of orientation."
    mc "Luckily there was a professor there who told me where I was supposed to go."
    mc "And that’s how I ended up in the breakout room."
    c "You met a professor?"
    c "I don’t think there are any professors on campus right now."
    c "Classes haven’t started so they have no reason to be here."
    p "You’re right. Come to think of it, I haven't seen any professors either."
    mc "Huh I didn’t think of that."
    mc "She was definitely older than us and seemed really knowledgeable."
    c "You better not be trying to get ahead of me before the semester even starts."
    mc "Don’t worry, I don’t have to try, I am already ahead of you."
    mc "Anyway, what did you guys think about JavaScript?"
    p "She seemed really nice."
    c "She just does too much."
    c "She was always saying “slay” or “queen”"
